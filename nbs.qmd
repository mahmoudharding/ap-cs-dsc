# Notebooks

## Jupyter Notebooks

This project is implemented using Jupyter notebooks, which serve as the primary workspace for data analysis. Jupyter notebooks combine code, text, and visual output in a single environment.

A reference guide summarizing the Python libraries, functions, and methods used across the notebooks is provided later in this guide.

## Notebook Descriptions

### Notebook 1: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks (Optional)

Introduces the Jupyter notebook environment and basic workflow, including running cells, editing code, and formatting text.

### Notebook 2: Basic Python and Data Structures

Introduces Python data structures for students transitioning from Java, with a focus on lists, dictionaries, and iteration as tools for working with data.

### Notebook 3: Pandas and Basic Data Exploration

Introduces Pandas for loading datasets, inspecting variables, and computing basic summary statistics.

### Notebook 4: Visualizing Distributions

Introduces Matplotlib for creating visualizations to explore and interpret the distribution of numerical variables.

### Notebook 5: Visualizing Trends

Examines patterns and trends over time using computational tools and visual evidence.

### Notebook 6: Exploring Relationships and Trends

Emphasizes student choice by allowing students to explore questions of interest, investigate relationships between variables, and support claims with data.
