## Missing & Non-Substantive Codes

This section describes codes used to represent missing, inapplicable, or non-substantive responses in the GSS. Missing and non-substantive codes appear in survey data when a question does not apply to a respondent, was skipped, or could not be answered. These values are not errors.

Some missing values occur because a question was never asked (for example, it was not included in a particular survey year), while others reflect meaningful responses such as “don’t know” or “not applicable.”

When analyzing the data, these codes should be handled intentionally. In most cases, they should be excluded from summaries and visualizations, rather than treated as valid responses.

| Code | Meaning | Notes & When It Appears |
|----|----|----|
| `NaN` | Missing value (numeric) | Pandas missing value; appears in numeric columns |
| `.i:  Inapplicable` | Inapplicable | Question does not apply due to skip patterns or survey design |
| `.n:  No answer` | No answer | Question was asked, but no valid response recorded |
| `.d:  Do not Know/Cannot Choose` | Don’t know / cannot choose | Respondent could not or would not provide a substantive answer |
| `.s:  Skipped on Web` | Skipped on web | Respondent skipped the question in web-based surveys |
| `.y:  Not available in this year` | Not asked in this year | Variable not included in that survey year |

::: {.callout-note title="Working with Missing Values"}
Missing and non-substantive codes are not errors. They indicate when a question did not apply, was skipped, or could not be answered. These values should usually be excluded from summaries and visualizations.
