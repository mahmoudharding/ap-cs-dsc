## General Social Survey

The project uses data from the [General Social Survey (GSS)](https://gss.norc.org/). The GSS is primarily funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and conducted by the [National Opinion Research Center (NORC)](https://www.norc.org/), a non-partisan research organization. The GSS collects data on a variety of topics in contemporary American society to monitor and explain trends in opinions, attitudes, and behaviors.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are education, civil liberties, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, and social mobility. It allows researchers to examine the structure and functioning of society in general, as well as the role played by relevant subgroups.

## About the General Social Survey

The GSS is a nationally representative series of cross-sectional interviews conducted in the United States since 1972. By adapting questions from earlier surveys, the GSS enables comparisons across decades. Originally proposed by James A. Davis, the survey has been administered by NORC at the University of Chicago and funded by the NSF since its inception. The GSS is currently designed by a set of Principal Investigators, with guidance from a Board of researchers.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 GSS implemented methodological changes, including a shift to address-based sampling with a push-to-web, self-administered questionnaire. The 2022 GSS was designed as a bridge between the traditional face-to-face data collection used from 1972–2018 and the web-based approach introduced in 2021. It retained many questionnaire changes from the web mode while returning to a mixed-mode design that included face-to-face, web, and telephone data collection. The 2022 GSS was structured to facilitate comparison with the 2018 GSS and represents the first stage of a broader transition to a mixed-mode survey.

## The Project Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a subset of the full GSS dataset, downloaded on December 31, 2025. The original dataset contained 46 variables and 75,699 observations.

### Data Preparation & Cleaning

The dataset used in this project is based on the original GSS data but includes pre-processing steps to support classroom use and analysis.

The following changes were made prior to student use:

-   A subset of variables and observations relevant to the project was selected.
-   Non-substantive response codes (e.g., `.i:  Inapplicable`, `.n:  No answer`) were kept in their original form; some were removed or recoded during cleaning.
-   The variable `age_group` was created.
-   Variables originally labeled `cohort` and `year` were renamed to `birth_year` and `survey_year`.
-   The variable `wwwhr` was recoded from categorical response values to numeric.
-   The dataset was filtered to include respondents age 51 and under.

These steps were taken to reduce complexity while preserving the structure and integrity of the original survey data.

Teachers and students should be aware that the dataset is not a raw extract from the GSS, but a prepared version intended for instructional use.

### Tidy and Tame Data Considerations

The project dataset has been prepared to follow principles of tidy data [@wickham2014tidydata] and tame data [@kim2018fivethirtyeight] to support exploratory analysis.

In this dataset:

-   Each row represents a single institution.
-   Each column represents a single variable.
-   Each cell contains a single, well-defined value.

Variables were also selected and organized to make the dataset *tame*, meaning, manageable, interpretable, and appropriate for classroom analysis. This includes limiting the number of variables, using consistent naming conventions, and providing variables that are meaningful for comparative analysis across institutions.

These design choices reduce unnecessary data wrangling and allow students to focus on asking questions, exploring patterns, and interpreting results, while still working with authentic, real-world data.
