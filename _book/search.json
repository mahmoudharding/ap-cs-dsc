The 2022 GSS Cross-section bridges the traditional face-to-face data collection of the GSS from 1972-2018 with the web-based collection of 2021, keeping many of the questionnaire changes brought about by the new mode, while reverting to a mixed mode data collection that include face to face, web and telephone. The 2022 GSS was designed to facilitate a comparison to the 2018 GSS; that is, the 2022 study aimed to resemble the 2018 GSS. Additionally, the 2022 GSS retained several methodological experiments conducted in the 2021 GSS that are specific to the web mode.

Missing and non-substantive codes appear in survey data when a question does not apply to a respondent, was skipped, or could not be answered. These values are not errors.\nSome missing values occur because a question was never asked (for example, it was not included in a particular survey year), while others reflect meaningful responses such as “don’t know” or “not applicable.”\nWhen analyzing the data, these codes should be handled intentionally. In most cases, they should be excluded from summaries and visualizations, rather than treated as valid responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nMeaning\nNotes & When It Appears\n\n\n\n\nNaN\nMissing value (numeric)\nPandas missing value; appears in numeric columns\n\n\n.i:  Inapplicable\nInapplicable\nQuestion does not apply due to skip patterns or survey design\n\n\n.n:  No answer\nNo answer\nQuestion was asked, but no valid response recorded\n\n\n.d:  Do not Know/Cannot Choose\nDon’t know / cannot choose\nRespondent could not or would not provide a substantive answer\n\n\n.s:  Skipped on Web\nSkipped on web\nRespondent skipped the question in web-based surveys\n\n\n.y:  Not available in this year\nNot asked in this year\nVariable not included in that survey year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Missing Values\n\n\n\nMissing and non-substantive codes are not errors.

The original dataset contained 46 variables and 75,699 observations.\n\nData Preparation & Cleaning\nThe dataset used in this project is based on the original GSS data but includes pre-processing steps to support classroom use and analysis.\nThe following changes were made prior to student use:\n\nA subset of variables and observations relevant to the project was selected.\nNon-substantive response codes (e.g., .i:  Inapplicable, .n:  No answer) were kept in their original form; some were removed or recoded during cleaning.\nThe variable age_group was created.\nVariables originally labeled cohort and year were renamed to birth_year and survey_year.\nThe variable wwwhr was recoded from categorical response values to numeric.\nThe dataset was filtered to include respondents age 51 and under.\n\nThese steps were taken to reduce complexity while preserving the structure and integrity of the original survey data.\nTeachers and students should be aware that the dataset is not a raw extract from the GSS, but a prepared version intended for instructional use.\n\n\nTidy and Tame Data Considerations\nThe project dataset has been prepared to follow principles of tidy data (Wickham 2014) and tame data (Kim, Ismay, and Chunn 2018) to support exploratory analysis.\nIn this dataset:\n\nEach row represents a single institution.\nEach column represents a single variable.\nEach cell contains a single, well-defined value.\n\nVariables were also selected and organized to make the dataset tame, meaning, manageable, interpretable, and appropriate for classroom analysis. This includes limiting the number of variables, using consistent naming conventions, and providing variables that are meaningful for comparative analysis across institutions.\nThese design choices reduce unnecessary data wrangling and allow students to focus on asking questions, exploring patterns, and interpreting results, while still working with authentic, real-world data.\n\n\n\n\nKim, Albert Y., Chester Ismay, and Jennifer Chunn. 2018. “The Fivethirtyeight r Package: ’Tame Data’ Principles for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses.” Technology Innovations in Statistics Education 11 (1). https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0rx1231m.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley. 2014. “Tidy Data.” Journal of Statistical Software 59. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10.",

    "text": "Overview of a Jupyter Notebook\nJupyter notebooks allow users to create and share documents that combine code, equations, visualizations, and formatted text (Stokes and Harding 2025). They are commonly used for data science because users can write and run code step by step, document their thinking, and view results directly alongside the code that produced them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid Multiple Tabs\n\n\n\nAvoid opening multiple notebooks in separate tabs, as this can lead to memory overload, forcing you to restart your session.",

A valid Python variable name must start with a letter or an underscore, use only letters, numbers, and underscores, and can’t be a reserved Python keyword.\nExample\n\n_five = 5\npi = 3.14159\ncourse_name = \"Data Science\"\n\nprint(_five)\nprint(pi)\nprint(course_name)\n\n5\n3.14159\nData Science\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Operations\nPython supports standard arithmetic operations.\nExample\n\nprint(_five + pi)\nprint(_five * pi)\nprint(_five / 2)\nprint(_five ** 2)\n\n8.14159\n15.70795\n2.5\n25\n\n\n\n\nLists\nLists store ordered collections of values. They can contain elements of different data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans.\nExample\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, \"3\", 4, 5]\nmixed_list = [True, 2.0, 3, \"four\", 5.]\n\nprint(numbers)\nprint(mixed_list)\n\n[1, 2, '3', 4, 5]\n[True, 2.0, 3, 'four', 5.0]\n\n\n\n\n2.0 – Python for This Project: Data Structures\n\nLists\n(Dictionaries are introduced in this same section, alongside lists.)\n\n\n\n4.0 – For Loops in Python",
