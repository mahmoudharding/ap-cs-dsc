## Notebook 1: Basic Python & Data Structures

### Variables and Assignment

Python variables are created by assignment. A valid Python variable name must start with a letter or an underscore, use only letters, numbers, and underscores, and can't be a reserved Python keyword.

**Example**

```{python}
#| label: py-variables
_five = 5
pi = 3.14159
course_name = "Data Science"

print(_five)
print(pi)
print(course_name)
```

### Numeric Operations

Python supports standard arithmetic operations.

**Example**

```{python}
#| label: py-arithmetic
print(_five + pi)
print(_five * pi)
print(_five / 2)
print(_five ** 2)
```

### Lists

Lists store ordered collections of values. They can contain elements of different data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans.

**Example**

```{python}
#| label: py-lists
numbers = [1, 2, "3", 4, 5]
mixed_list = [True, 2.0, 3, "four", 5.]

print(numbers)
print(mixed_list)
```

## Notebook 6: Exploring Relationships & Trends in Survey Data

### Overview of the Steps

1.  Choose two variables to compare (groups or time + a survey question response).
2.  Decide whether you are examining a relationship or a trend.
3.  Write a comparison question.
4.  Prepare the data for analysis.
5.  Create summaries and visualizations.
6.  Describe what the data shows.

### 3.0 – Data Exploration & Visualization

-   Insert code cells to create summaries and visualizations.
-   After each code cell, add a short explanation of what the output shows and how it helps answer the question.
