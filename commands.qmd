## Notebook 1: Basic Python & Data Structures

### Variables and Assignment

Python variables are created by assignment. A valid Python variable name must start with a letter or an underscore, use only letters, numbers, and underscores, and can't be a reserved Python keyword.

**Example**

```{python}
#| label: py-variables
course_name = "Data Science"
pi = 3.14159
_five = 5

print(_five)
print(pi)
print(course_name)
```

### Numeric Operations

Python supports standard arithmetic operations.

**Example**

```{python}
#| label: py-arithmetic
print(_five + pi)
print(_five * pi)
print(_five / 2)
print(_five ** 2)
```

### Lists

Lists store ordered collections of values. They can contain elements of different data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans.

**Example**

```{python}
#| label: py-lists
numbers = [1, 2, "3", 4, 5]
mixed_list = [True, 2.0, 3, "four", 5.]

print(numbers)
print(mixed_list)
```
