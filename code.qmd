# Code Reference

## Python Libraries Used

Python libraries are collections of prewritten code that support common tasks. This project uses `pandas` for data analysis and `matplotlib` for data visualization.

### Pandas

`pandas` is a Python library used for working with structured, tabular data. It provides tools for loading datasets, selecting and transforming variables, computing summary statistics, and preparing data for analysis.

### Matplotlib

`matplotlib` is a Python library used for creating visual representations of data. In this project, it is used to generate charts and graphs to explore distributions, compare groups, and examine trends.

## Common Data Structures

-   lists
