The guide supports high school computer science teachers in planning and facilitating a data science project that builds on students’ prior programming experience and does not assume prior coursework in statistics or data science.\nIt explains the structure of the project, the dataset used, and the types of analyses students are expected to pursue. The project is intended for students who have completed AP Computer Science Principles or AP Computer Science A, or who have comparable experience with text-based programming.",

    "text": "About the General Social Survey\nThe GSS is a nationally representative series of cross-sectional interviews conducted in the United States since 1972. By adapting questions from earlier surveys, the GSS enables comparisons across decades. Originally proposed by James A. Davis, the survey has been administered by NORC at the University of Chicago and funded by the NSF since its inception. The GSS is currently designed by a set of Primary Investigators, with guidance from a Board of researchers.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 GSS implemented methodological changes, including a shift to address-based sampling with a push-to-web, self-administered questionnaire. The 2022 GSS was designed as a bridge between the traditional face-to-face data collection used from 1972–2018 and the web-based approach introduced in 2021. It retained many questionnaire changes from the web mode while returning to a mixed-mode design that included face-to-face, web, and telephone data collection. The 2022 GSS was structured to facilitate comparison with the 2018 GSS and represents the first stage of a broader transition to a mixed-mode survey.",

The original dataset contained 46 variables and 75,699 observations.\n\nData Preparation & Cleaning\nThe dataset used in this project is based on the original GSS data but includes pre-processing steps to support classroom use and analysis.\nThe following changes were made prior to student use:\n\nA subset of variables and observations relevant to the project was selected.\nNon-substantive response codes (e.g., .i:  Inapplicable, .n:  No answer) were kept in their original form; some were removed or recoded during cleaning.\nThe variable age_group was created.\nVariables originally labeled cohort and year were renamed to birth_year and survey_year.\nThe variable wwwhr was recoded from categorical response values to numeric.\nThe dataset was filtered to include respondents age 51 and under.\n\nThese steps were taken to reduce complexity while preserving the structure and integrity of the original survey data.\nTeachers and students should be aware that the dataset is not a raw extract from the GSS, but a prepared version intended for instructional use.\n\n\nTidy and Tame Data Considerations\nThe project dataset has been prepared to follow principles of tidy data (Wickham 2014) and tame data (Kim, Ismay, and Chunn 2018) to support exploratory analysis.\nIn this dataset:\n\nEach row represents a single institution.\nEach column represents a single variable.\nEach cell contains a single, well-defined value.\n\nVariables were also selected and organized to make the dataset tame, meaning, manageable, interpretable, and appropriate for classroom analysis. This includes limiting the number of variables, using consistent naming conventions, and providing variables that are meaningful for comparative analysis across institutions.\nThese design choices reduce unnecessary data wrangling and allow students to focus on asking questions, exploring patterns, and interpreting results, while still working with authentic, real-world data.\n\n\n\n\nKim, Albert Y., Chester Ismay, and Jennifer Chunn. 2018. “The Fivethirtyeight r Package: ’Tame Data’ Principles for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses.” Technology Innovations in Statistics Education 11 (1). https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0rx1231m.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley. 2014. “Tidy Data.” Journal of Statistical Software 59. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10.",

Missing and non-substantive codes appear in survey data when a question does not apply to a respondent, was skipped, or could not be answered. These values are not errors.\nSome missing values occur because a question was never asked (for example, it was not included in a particular survey year), while others reflect meaningful responses such as “don’t know” or “not applicable.”\nWhen analyzing the data, these codes should be handled intentionally. In most cases, they should be excluded from summaries and visualizations, rather than treated as valid responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nMeaning\nNotes & When It Appears\n\n\n\n\nNaN\nMissing value (numeric)\nPandas missing value; appears in numeric columns\n\n\n.i:  Inapplicable\nInapplicable\nQuestion does not apply due to skip patterns or survey design\n\n\n.n:  No answer\nNo answer\nQuestion was asked, but no valid response recorded\n\n\n.d:  Do not Know/Cannot Choose\nDon’t know / cannot choose\nRespondent could not or would not provide a substantive answer\n\n\n.s:  Skipped on Web\nSkipped on web\nRespondent skipped the question in web-based surveys\n\n\n.y:  Not available in this year\nNot asked in this year\nVariable not included in that survey year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Missing Values\n\n\n\nMissing and non-substantive codes are not errors. They indicate when a question did not apply, was skipped, or could not be answered. These values should usually be excluded from summaries and visualizations.",

For this project, you will use only two:\n\nCode cells for writing and running Python code\nMarkdown or text cells for entering written responses.\n\n\nRunning Cells in a Jupyter Notebook\nIn a Jupyter Notebook, you run cells one at a time to see code output or display formatted text. To run a cell, click inside the cell and then click the Run button in the toolbar at the top of the notebook.\n\n\n\nRun button in the Jupyter toolbar\n\n\nYou can also use keyboard shortcuts:\n\nPCs and Chromebooks: Hold Ctrl and press Enter\nMacs: Hold Command (⌘) and press Enter\n\n\n\nAdding Cells\nUse the + button in the top toolbar to add a new cell.\n\n\n\n+ button in the Jupyter toolbar\n\n\nThen set the cell type as needed:\n\n\n\nCode or Markdown button in the Jupyter toolbar\n\n\n\nChoose Code for code\nChoose Markdown for text\n\n\n\nRunning All Cells from Top Down\nThe Save button saves your code and text, but it does not save data stored in memory. Whenever you reopen a notebook, you should re-run all code cells from the top.\nTo do this, go to Kernel → Restart & Run All.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart & Run All\n\n\n\nThis option restarts the notebook and runs every cell in order from top to bottom. If a code cell encounters an error, execution will stop and later cells will not run.\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart & Run All button in the Jupyter toolbar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStokes, David J., and Mahmoud Harding. 2025. “A Project-Based Approach to Introductory R and Python for Data Science.” https://djstokes02.github.io/IntroRPython4DS/.",
